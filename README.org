** Minor mode Php-Refill.

** Added it to your init.el

We recommend using this package with a major mode for PHP, like the ones supply by packages like [[https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/php-mode.html][php-mode]] and [[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/phps-mode.html][phps-mode]], to get the indentation right and for the hook.

The following example uses ‘php-mode’, but if a different major mode were to be used, just change ‘php-mode’ with something else like ‘phps-mode’ instead.

While in the process of being accepted in either [[https://elpa.gnu.org/][elpa.gnu.org]] or [[https://elpa.nongnu.org/][elpa.nongnu.org]], please download ‘php-fill.el’ and add it by using its holding location, shown here as "~/.emacs.d/lisp/" as an example.
